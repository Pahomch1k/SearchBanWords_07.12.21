I just got rich in the neighborhood 
I just got rich in the neighborhood 
I just got rich in the neighborhood 
I just got rich in the neighborhood
Hoodrich (Hoodrich), Big Meech
I got rich bitch, I got G, you snitch
I saw her breasts, you still want a feature
That's your bitch, ha, she's just a bitch
My trauma will give you paralysis
You are not a shooter, you are an ordinary Muscovite
There are at least two personalities in my psyche
What happens to my life is logical
More interesting than sex, it's better than money
Every new concert of mine is like a birthday
Br-r-rya, 2-2-3, Glock-9
Blicky leaves only shadows from you
I do not commit crimes, on the path of correction
Influencers are just plants
25 thousand dollars for my performance
Dropped this track - earthquake, on you, boom
